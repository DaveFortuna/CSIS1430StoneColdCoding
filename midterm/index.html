    <p class="home">
      Here at Pizza Pizza we are almost all about pizza! We are also about
      customer satisfaction: we make sure that table is wiped off and the floor
      is so clean you can eat off of it. Wouldn't go throwing that fantastic pie
      on the floor, but if you insist you can go to our pie-on-floor room. We
      ask that no shoes or socks be brought into that room. Why? Well, shoes are
      gross. We have a Pizza Pizza Play Place. Nothing like McDonalds - this one
      you can eat in as well! Tomato sauce slide baby!! Come on down to Pizza
      Pizza for a slice. You will leave full and satisfied!
