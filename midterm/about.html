    <p id="about">
      T'was the year 1892. All the pizza places around town had shut down.
      Couldn't get a decent slice for miles. Then Doug "dough boy" Dilly came up
      with with the idea to start Pizza Pizza. Pizza Pizza got it's name from
      Doug always saying Pizza Pizza in place of, almost any yes or no question.
      Had to listen to his voice to really get a sense if he waa about it or
      not. Doug really brought back the pizza scene. From the revolutionary
      pepperoni idea to the reverse seared anchovie delight. Many called him mad
      when he put a scoop of ice cream on top. Other couldn't fathom the thought
      of a burrito on a pizza. Doug did and he made it a staple here at Pizza
      Pizza.
