    <p id="about">
      T'was the year 1892. All the pizza places around town had shut down.
      Couldn't get a decent slice for miles. Then Doug "dough boy" Dilly came up
      with with the idea to start Pizza Pizza. Pizza Pizza got its name from
      Doug always saying Pizza Pizza in response to almost any yes or no
      question. Had to listen to his voice to really get a sense if he was about
      it or not. Doug really brought back the pizza scene. From the
      revolutionary pepperoni idea to the reverse seared anchovy delight. Many
      called him mad when he put a scoop of ice cream on top. Others couldn't
      fathom the thought of a burrito on a pizza. Doug did and he made it a
      staple here at Pizza Pizza.
